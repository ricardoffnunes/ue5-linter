# Unreal Engine 5 Linter

Welcome to the **Unreal Engine 5 Linter** repository! This project aims to provide a powerful linting tool for Unreal Engine 5 developers, enabling them to analyze and improve the quality of their codebase.

A linter is an essential utility that helps identify and highlight potential issues, inconsistencies, and best practice violations within your Unreal Engine projects. By integrating this linter into your development workflow, you can catch errors, improve code readability, enforce coding conventions, and promote maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Code Analysis**: The linter performs a comprehensive analysis of your Unreal Engine 5 project's code, including Blueprints, C++, and other supported scripting languages.
- **Error Detection**: Identify and report common coding errors, such as unused variables, uninitialized values, invalid function calls, and more.
- **Style Guide Enforcement**: Configure and enforce coding conventions based on industry-standard guidelines or your custom style preferences.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate code analysis and ensure code quality by integrating the linter with your CI/CD pipelines.
- **IDE Integration Support**: Seamlessly integrate the linter into your existing Unreal Engine 5 development environment, enhancing your IDE's capabilities.
- **Customization Options**: Customize the linter's rules and settings to align with your project's specific requirements and coding standards.

## Project Milestones

1. **Style Guide Enforcement** - Develop configurable rules and provide automated enforcement of coding conventions.
2. **Customization Options** - Allow users to customize linting rules and settings to align with project requirements.
3. **TeamCity Integration** - Enable integration with TeamCity CI/CD pipelines to automate code analysis and ensure code quality.
4. **Error Detection and Reporting** - Identify common coding errors and provide detailed reports for easy debugging.
5. **Visual Studio Code Integration** - Provide seamless integration with popular development environments used by Unreal Engine developers in Visual Studio Code.
6. **Documentation and Examples** - Create comprehensive documentation and examples to help users get started quickly.

## Supported Unreal Engine versions
